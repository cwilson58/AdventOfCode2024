# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2024

## What is the goal?
The goal this year is to learn more JS, I didn't focus on web development in school so my JS isn't the best. Since I use it at work, the idea here is to use these puzzles to improve those skills.

I won't be targeting the best performance for this year, just solving it using the Node.js run time and libraries only when it makes sense to do so.

## Later items
In the future, I may go back and refactor my solutions to perform better. Currently correct result > fast result is the goal.
